# 🐍 Snake Game
A simple Python implementation of the classic Snake game using the `turtle` module.
The classic Snake Game is a simple yet addictive arcade-style program where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen. The snake starts small and grows longer each time it eats food that appears randomly on the board. The objective is to keep the snake alive as long as possible while collecting points by eating food.
